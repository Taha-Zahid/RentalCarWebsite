- Sign up
- Log in

- Checks invalid email or password on both server and client during both login and signup
- Request to rent a car (saves requests per account)
- Prevents rental requests when not signed in
- Cancel rent request
- Remains logged in after refreshing
- file hosting (css, html, images) on local server
- Designed intuitively (such as options to log out and create listings are only shown when the
user is logged in, displaying one option (like log in option) hides the rest (like sign up
and create listings)
